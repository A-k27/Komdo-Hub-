<h2><ins>Behaviour</ins></h2>
<br>
 <p>Crested black macaques are primarily, though not exclusively, terrestrial. This means they spend the majority of their time, about 60%, on the ground. Like other macaques, they are diurnal—i.e., awake during the day. Typically, they spend their mornings socializing. As with most primates, they are extremely social and rely heavily on their groups. In the afternoon, they forage. They travel about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) per day, although in undisturbed forests they travel shorter distances because of the higher abundance of fruit. At night, crested black macaques find a tree to spend the night in. This helps to keep them safe from terrestrial predators. </p>
<br>
<h2><ins>Conservation Status & Threats</ins></h2>
<br>
<p>TThe International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the crested black macaque as Critically Endangered (IUCN, 2020), appearing on the IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species. This is the last step before extinction in the wild. Since systematic population surveys began in the 1970s, severe population loss has been documented. It is believed that the population of crested black macaques has decreased by more than 80% in just the past 30 or so years, about three generations. Scientists believe that there is just a single viable population of crested black macaques left, in the Greater Tangkok Conservation Area. However, this population lives in a degraded and fragmented habitat. Outside of this population, crested black macaques mostly exist in very small, scattered groups. These groups are so small that they likely won’t survive long-term. </p>
<br>
<p>The main threats against crested black macaques are hunting pressure and habitat loss. Crested black macaques are frequently hunted for meat throughout their range, and their meat is an important cultural food for special occasions and large gatherings among the local people. Unfortunately, this hunting puts immense pressure on a highly threatened species. Beyond subsistence hunting, the macaques are also trapped as crop pests, since they are known to eat from gardens and agricultural fields. Some crested black macaques are also caught for the pet trade.</p>
