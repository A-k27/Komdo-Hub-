    <img src="/Images/baliMyna.jpg" class = "imgCentre" >
<h2><ins>Status & Conservation</ins></h2>
<br>
 <p>The Bali myna faces critical endangerment, nearing extinction in the wild since around 1994. Estimated at fewer than 100 adults in the wild as of 2015, approximately 1,000 are believed to exist in captivity. Categorized under Appendix I of CITES, trade in these birds, even those bred in captivity, is strictly controlled, making them generally unavailable legally to private individuals. Nonetheless, experienced aviculturists may participate in captive-breeding initiatives, enabling legal possession of this species. It's estimated that twice the number of birds acquired legally in breeding programs are purchased through the black market. </p>
<br>
<p>In 2018, three locations in Bali were identified as habitats for these birds: West Bali National Park, the small island of Nusa Penida, and the breeding and release site at Melinggih Kelod, Payangan, run by the Begawan Foundation.</p>

As a guarantee, each breeder must offer a cow as collateral in case of the birds' demise. Breeders are mandated to release 10% of the offspring into West Bali National Park, while the remainder can be sold privately. Additionally, a pair of Bali Mynas at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is part of the Species Survival Program. </p>
