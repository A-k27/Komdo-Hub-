<h2><ins>Habitat</ins></h2>
<br>
 <p>Tarsiers strictly inhabit forests of Southeast Asia. They reside in both primary and secondary habitats. These arboreal primates are found in forests that range in density and agriculture from island to island. Tarsiers main mode of locomotion is leaping from tree to tree. Tarsiers, being noctural, sleep during the daylight and predominantly roost in dense vegetation.Vegetation includes shrubs, bamboo, palm, dense thickets of grass, bush, thorn scrubs, and secondary habitats on plantations for logging and growing coffee, nutmeg, coconut, or coca crops. </p>
<br>
<h2><ins>Lifespan</ins></h2>
<br>
<p>Longevity and lifespan has not yet been established for many species of Tarsius. Any evidence of captive lifespan is not directly applicable to wild tarsier lifespan. The longest reported lifespan in captivity is over 17 years. The oldest individual caught in the wild is estimated at 10 years old. Tarsier behavior changes due to old age between 14 and 16 years of age. Signs of advanced aging may include graying of hair around the face and dental wear. </p>
<br>
<h2><ins>Conservation Status</ins></h2>
<br>
<p>Habitat loss and deforestation contributes to a decline in tarsier populations. Currently, tarsiers reside in many protected areas. T. bancanus, T. dentatus, and T. tarsier are considered vulnerable. Tarsius syrichta is considered near threatened. Tarsius pelengensis and T. sangirensis are considered endangered. Tarsius tumpara is considered critically endangered. Tarsius lariang, T. pumilus, and T. wallacei are listed as data deficient. Tarsiers are protected through international treaties.</p>
